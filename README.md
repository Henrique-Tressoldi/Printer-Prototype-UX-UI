# Printer-Prototype-UX-UI
High-fidelity HTML/CSS prototype of a multifunction printer interface for the HCI course at UTFPR. Features 12 screens demonstrating usability guidelines, hybrid accessibility (touch/physical), and error handling based on Cognitive and Semiotic Engineering principles.


# Multifunction Printer Interface - HCI Final Project

This repository contains the high-fidelity prototype developed as the Final Project for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at UTFPR.

**Student:** Henrique Menezes Tressoldi

## 📋 About the Project

The goal of this project was to design and prototype the interface for a multifunction device (Printer, Copier, and Scanner). The main focus was not just aesthetics, but the rigorous application of HCI guidelines, Cognitive Engineering, and Semiotic Engineering to ensure:

* **Usability:** Ease of learning and efficiency of use.
* **Communicability:** Clarity in conveying the designer's logic to the user.
* **Hybrid Accessibility:** Interface designed to be operated via both *touch screen* and a physical button panel (simulated at the bottom of the interface).

## 🚀 Features and Screens

The prototype covers 12 critical system states, meeting all project requirements:

1.  **Main Menu:** Clear navigation with visual hierarchy.
2.  **Print Configuration:** Source selection (USB, Cloud) and quick adjustments.
3.  **Copy Adjustments:** Use of analog sliders for density and zoom control.
4.  **Scanning:** Workflows for Email, Network, and USB with preference memory.
5.  **Error Handling (Paper Jam/Empty):** Constructive messages with step-by-step instructions.
6.  **Safety Warnings:** Operation lockout with open lid (Constraint).
7.  **Progress Feedback:** Visual progress bars for long operations.
8.  **Connectivity Errors:** Recovery options and alternative paths (Save to USB).
9.  **Destructive Action Confirmation:** Prevention of accidental cancellations.
10. **Preventive Maintenance:** Proactive toner level and cleaning alerts.
11. **Global Settings:** Accessibility, language, and network settings.
12. **Operation History:** "Repeat Task" function for efficiency.

## 🧠 Applied HCI Concepts

The design was grounded in the following guideline categories:

* **General Interaction:** Visual consistency, informative feedback, and easy reversal of actions.
* **Data Entry:** Minimization of actions (use of smart defaults) and error prevention.
* **Information Display:** Use of analog displays, meaningful error messages, and reduction of memory load.

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Used to create a responsive layout faithful to a real LCD panel.
* **Single-File Structure:** The entire structure was consolidated into a single file to facilitate sequential viewing and screenshot capture for the final report.

## 📦 How to View

1.  Download the `multifuncional_final_entrega.html` file.
2.  Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3.  The view presents all 12 screens in a vertical sequence, ready for analysis.
